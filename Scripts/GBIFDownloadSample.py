'''

    Sample scripting to use pygbif's occurrence module download request.
    This will download a zip file of Darwin Core Archive files. The file
    "occurrence.txt" is the file with species records.
    Additionally, installing the dwca-reader package will facilitate
    reading the Darwin Core Archive occurrence file into a Pandas
    dataframe for further manipulation.
    
    You must have a GBIF account to access the downloading ability. Once
    you have established an account, you will need to use the username
    and password as parameters in the download function. These can either
    be supplied directly in the code, can be set in your user environment
    variable for your OS, or be created in a separate config file.

     the file size, and the download key unique code. It can be used
